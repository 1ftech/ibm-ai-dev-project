# IBM AI Developer Professional Certificate 🧠

## 🎓 Overview
The **IBM AI Developer Professional Certificate** is a comprehensive, hands-on program designed to equip learners with the core skills needed to build, deploy, and operationalize AI-powered applications. Over several in-depth courses, I gained expertise in foundational AI concepts, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and the use of tools and frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and IBM Watson.

This certification provided both theoretical knowledge and practical experience through labs and assignments on IBM Cloud, enabling end-to-end AI development skills.
